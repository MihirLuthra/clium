[-a|--alias-file]:
	This file is for creating aliases. A value needs to
	be given to the alias which can contain a combination
	of functions and/or text. When preprocessing file, a search
	is made for these alias names and their preprocessed value
	is substituted.

[-c|--create-func <func_name>]:
	Just opens the file in which function can be defined.

[-d|--delete [<func_name>]]:
	Will execute `rm -i` for the given func name.
	If no arg is supplied, fzf search menu opens up.

[-h|--help]:
	Shows help for function in less.

[-m|--modify-func [<func_name>]]:
	Just opens the file in which function can be modified.
	If no arg is supplied, fzf search menu opens up.

[-r|--rename-file]:
	This file is for renaming the existing aliases or funcs.
	There can be a rare case when I file contains a quicktest
	func in its text which would get replaced but wasn't intended to
	be that way. Rename file can be used to give a new name to
	that func so that preprocessor doesn't process that text in
	the target file.

[-s|--show-all]:
	Shows all funcs.
