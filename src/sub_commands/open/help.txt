[<relative_count>]:
	This is an argument to `open` which is the relative
	count to the previously opened instances.
	For example, if this option is 2, it would mean
	the second last instance that was opened.

-b|--boilerplate [<boilerplate_name>]:
	With this you can specify the boilerplate to be used
	for the current open operation. Without this the boilerplate
	as per the user config file gets used.
	The arg [<boilerplate_name>] is optional as if it wasn't
	specified, a serarch menu will open for you to select from
	all boilerplates.
	Boilerplates are only significant if -n|--new is used
	because that causes the actually writing of boilerplate
	to instance file.

[--config-file]:
	Opens config file for open.

-h|--help:
	Provides help

-i|--instance [<instance_name>]:
	With this you can specify the instance to be opened.
	Without this option, the instance would be opened as
	per [relative_count [-g|--global]] arg to open.
	The arg [<instance_name>] is optional as if it wasn't
	specified, a serarch menu will open for you to select from
	all instances.

[-l|--last]:
	Opens last opened file in the current tty.

-n|--new:
	Causes the boilerplate to be written to the instance.

-u|--user-config [<user_config_name>]:
	With this you can specify the user config file to be used
	for current operation. During the next operation, the same
	would be used automatically until changed again.
	The arg [<user_config_name>] is optional as if it wasn't
	specified, a serarch menu will open for you to select from
	all user configs.
